      why_you: `
Before anything even started, I already had a quiet thought, "why him?" Because he stood out without even trying. 
It was just a silly crush of mine but I caught myself smiling in a ways I hadn't in long time, one of my friends
pa nga told me na "I'm glad na nag i-ismile ka na ulit Jo". I never expected that I would confess my feelings, 
kasi nga "crush" lang, that's what I thought too, you may think its weird that I started to like someone na 'di 
ko naman kilala haha.

Then when we finally had that week together, it confirmed everything. It wasn‚Äôt in my head. You really did make 
me feel better, safer, brighter. It wasn‚Äôt about replacing anyone or filling a gap ‚Äî it was just about you.

Why you?
Because whenever you were around, the weight I carry didn‚Äôt feel so heavy.
Because you made me smile without even trying.
Because you gave me that rare sense of ease, like I could just be myself without overthinking.
Because even in such a short time, I felt lighter with you than I have in a long time.

And maybe it‚Äôs over now, but I wish you knew that from the start, I chose you.
`,
    unsent: `
I think we both tried, but in the end we failed to really get to know each other. You couldn‚Äôt give me the time 
I needed, and I know I made you feel like a rebound ‚Äî even though that was never my intention. When I talked 
about my past, it wasn‚Äôt because I was stuck there. I wanted you to understand why I am the way I am now, 
how those experiences shaped me. But I see how it might not have come across that way.

I‚Äôm sad it ended like this, but I don‚Äôt regret meeting you. Even for a short time, you mattered.(09/25/25)
    
---

I wish we had more time. A week wasn‚Äôt enough, and it hurts that we‚Äôre just ending here. (09/26/25)

---

Sometimes I wish I could rewind and meet you at a better time in my life, when I wasn‚Äôt carrying so much. (09/27/25)

---

You mattered to me, even if it was brief. I‚Äôll remember this week, even if you forget it.(09/28/25)

---

I hate that this feels like a breakup even though we weren‚Äôt even together. That‚Äôs how much it meant to me. (09/29/25)

---

I miss the ease of talking to you. No one else feels like that right now. (09/30/25)

---

Part of me hopes this isn‚Äôt the end, just a pause. Maybe life circles back. Maybe someday. (10/01/25)

---

It‚Äôs strange how someone can walk into your life so quickly, change your rhythm, and then leave. You did that. (10/02/25)

---

I miss you in small ways that feel big. I miss the comfort in our talks, the way time felt softer with you, 
the tiny moments that made me forget the noise in my head. It‚Äôs only been a short time, but I feel the 
absence everywhere. (10/03/25)

---

I don‚Äôt think you realize how much you made me smile. It felt effortless, like my heart remembered how to 
be light again. That‚Äôs rare for me, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever forget it. (10/04/25)

---

I know I messed up by talking too much about my past. I wasn‚Äôt trying to make you a rebound. 
I just wanted you to understand me. You deserved to know who I am and where I‚Äôve been ‚Äî not 
just the easy parts, but the scars too. (10/05/25)

---

The truth is, I liked you before I admitted it to myself. When we started talking, 
it wasn‚Äôt casual for me, even if it looked that way. I was already hoping for more.(10/06/25)

---

I miss your presence, the way it changed my whole mood. I didn‚Äôt realize how rare 
that was until you weren‚Äôt here anymore. (10/07/25)

---

I keep replaying small moments, like flashes of us. They weren‚Äôt big or dramatic, 
but they meant everything to me.(10/08/25)

---

I didn‚Äôt expect to care this much. I thought it was just a week, nothing serious. 
But here I am, missing you like we had years.(10/09/25)

---

It stings that we never really started, but it still feels like I lost something real.(10/10/25)

---

What if we met at a different time? What if I‚Äôd been a little less broken, and you a 
little more free? Maybe then we‚Äôd have had a real chance.(10/11/25)

---

I hate that I might‚Äôve ruined this by oversharing. I never wanted to dump my past 
on you. I just wanted you to understand why I am the way I am. It wasn‚Äôt about him. 
It was always about you. (10/12/25)

---

I‚Äôll always be glad I met you, even if it was short. You reminded me that I can still feel light again.(10/13/25)
